Clean up documentation.  All function descriptions should be properly-formed
sentences terminated with a full stop(".").  Clean up style for consistency
where necessary.
Switch to javadoc-style eg. @param, not \param.
Turn on auto-brief mode and remove all \brief tags.
Code examples in documentation to demonstrate usage?
