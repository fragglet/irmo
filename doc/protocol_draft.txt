2 byte header:		bitmap:
			SYN	- connect: syn/syn-ack/ack
			ACK	- for connection
			FIN	- disconnect

if SYN:
	4 bytes for hash of local (connecting client) universe spec
		0 if no local universe
	4 bytes for hash of remote (server connecting to) universe spec
	up to 64 bytes for vhost name, 0 terminated
	end of packet

2 bytes for last acked point in stream (includes all new object, value
	and deletion messages) for data going the other way

// allow multiple clusters of atoms per packet?

2 bytes for position in stream

then n atoms as defined in start byte above.

data for each atom depends on type in start byte:
	ATOM_NULL:	no data
	ATOM_NEW:	
		2 bytes for object ID
		1 byte for object class number
	ATOM_CHANGE:
		1 byte for object class
		2 bytes for object ID
		bitfield of changed variables
		   (length depends on number of variables/class),
			bit on = variable changed
		for each changed variable:
			depending on type:
			TYPE_INT8:
				1 byte for new value
			TYPE_INT16:
				2 bytes for new value
			TYPE_INT32:
				4 bytes for new value
			TYPE_STRING:
				new string terminated by 0 (NUL)
	ATOM_DESTROY:
		2 bytes for id of destroyed object
	ATOM_METHOD:
		// todo

} 	next run of atoms

As objects are created, modified and destroyed new atoms are added to the
send queue. When the send window is empty, new atoms are read from the
queue and added to the send window.

If an object is destroyed while it has a change atom waiting to be sent,
the change atom is found from a hash table and nullified: it becomes a
ATOM_NULL type atom instead. As atoms are popped from the send queue,
any null atoms are automatically ignored and destroyed (they are not added
to the send window). As they have not been sent yet, it is safe to simply
discard them. However, once atoms reach the send window they cannot be 
removed as doing so could desync the protocol (the original change atom
might have been sent already). Instead, they are sent as NULL atoms.

In packets, atoms of the same type are grouped together (run length 
encoded by type). This allows the type of up to 32 consecutive atoms 
to be implied through only a single byte.

In sending change atoms, a bit field is used to indicate which variables 
are changed. For classes with <= 8 variables, only 1 byte is needed.
("delta" compression). The object class is included in the change atoms,
even though it is already implied from the object id. This is so the 
protocol is not ambiguous to decode. For example, consider a change
atom received for an object which has not yet been created: it is
therefore impossible to decode the packet.
