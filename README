Irmo is an abstracted multiplayer engine, in a library form. You can
use Irmo to add client-server multiplayer support to games quickly and
easily.

Irmo requires glib2, pkg-config and flex: you can get these here:

  http://www.glib.org/
  http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/
  http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/

It may work with other lexers, but has not been tested.

Irmo is documented using Doxygen: you can use doxygen to generate a 
full API reference. You can get doxygen here:
