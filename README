About

Irmo is an abstracted multiplayer engine, in a library form. You can
use Irmo to add client-server multiplayer support to games quickly and
easily.

Irmo requires flex: you can get it here:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/

It may work with other lexers, but has not been tested.

Irmo installs a pkg-config configuration file.  You may find it useful
to use pkg-config when linking against Irmo (although it is not
necessary).  You can find pkg-config here:

  http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/

Irmo is documented using Doxygen: you can use doxygen to generate a 
full API reference. You can get doxygen here:
